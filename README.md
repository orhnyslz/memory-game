# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

To play the game, open the file index.html in your browser. There are 16 cards with two symbols pairs Ã  8 unique symbols in total. Your goal is to find the two pairs in the card deck and match them together. The gameplay is as follows:

- A click on a card will keep that card open
- A click on a second card will keep both cards open if they match; if not, both will be shown for a short time and closed again.
- Your goal is to find and match the cards with the least amount of trials and time. Depending on your amount of trials, you'll be given a star rating.
- When all cards are matched, you'll be presented with your star rating, move count and overall time. You may play again if you wish :)
